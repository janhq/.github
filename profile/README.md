# Building Open Intelligence

We believe AI should be **open**, **private**, and **accessible to everyone**. Jan is building the infrastructure for a future where you own your AI — running locally on your hardware or self-hosted on your servers.

Our mission is to empower individuals, teams, and organizations to harness the power of AI without sacrificing privacy or control.
